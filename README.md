## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Warning

**This code is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. Any malicious use is strictly prohibited and illegal.**


## üìñ What is Dirty COW?

Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195) is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux Kernel that exploits a race condition in the kernel's copy-on-write (COW) mechanism. This vulnerability affects Linux kernels from version 2.6.22 (released in 2007) to versions before:

- 4.8.3
- 4.7.9  
- 4.4.26

### Technical Details

The vulnerability occurs in the kernel's memory management system:

1. **Copy-On-Write (COW)**: When a process maps a file with `MAP_PRIVATE`, modifications should create a private copy
2. **Race Condition**: Two threads racing between `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)` and writing to `/proc/self/mem`
3. **Exploitation**: Under specific timing conditions, writes can bypass COW protection and modify the original file

### Impact

- **Privilege Escalation**: Modify read-only files owned by root
- **System Compromise**: Potential to gain root access by modifying system files like `/etc/passwd`
- **Data Integrity**: Unauthorized modification of critical system files

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes for Testing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Test Only in Isolated Environment

**NEVER run this on production systems or systems you don't own!**

### Recommended Test Environment:

1. **Virtual Machine (VM)**: Use VMware, VirtualBox, or KVM
2. **Container**: Docker container with vulnerable kernel
3. **Isolated Lab**: Dedicated test machine with no important data
4. **Kernel Requirements**: Linux kernel versions 2.6.22 to 4.8.2

### Safe Testing Practices:

```bash
# 1. Check kernel version first
uname -r

# 2. Create isolated test directory
mkdir /tmp/dirtycow_test
cd /tmp/dirtycow_test

# 3. Test with harmless files only
./main -t /tmp/test_file -v

# 4. Monitor system resources
top -p $(pgrep -f main)
```

## üöÄ Compilation & Usage

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install required packages (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev

# Install required packages (CentOS/RHEL)
sudo yum install gcc openssl-devel
```

### Compilation

```bash
# Standard compilation
make

# Debug version
make main-debug

# Manual compilation
gcc -o main main.c -lpthread -lssl -lcrypto
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Simple test with default settings
./main

# Verbose mode with custom target
./main -t /tmp/testfile -v

# Advanced usage with multiple processes
./main -t /tmp/target -n 4 -r 3 -D -v

# Binary payload from file
./main -f payload.bin -P -D -n 2
```

### Command Line Options

| `-D` | Enable dynamic offset scanning | Disabled | - |
| `-v` | Verbose output | Disabled | - |
| `-l <file>` | Log file path | `exploit_log.txt` | - |
| `-h` | Show help | - | - |

## üî¨ Advanced Features

### 1. Multiple Attack Methods

- **Method 1**: `/proc/self/mem` writing (default)
- **Method 2**: `ptrace(PTRACE_POKETEXT)` for restricted systems

### 2. Dynamic Offset Scanning

Scans multiple memory offsets to find the best write position:

```bash
./main -D -v  # Enable dynamic offset scanning
```

### 3. Multi-Process Race Conditions

Launch multiple processes for intense race conditions:

```bash
./main -n 4  # Use 4 parallel processes
```

### 4. Binary Payload Support

Load arbitrary binary data from files:

```bash
# Create binary payload
echo -ne '\x41\x41\x41\x41\x00\x42\x42' > payload.bin

# Use binary payload
./main -f payload.bin -v
```

### 5. Automatic Retry Logic

Retry failed attempts automatically:

```bash
./main -r 5  # Retry up to 5 times
```

### 6. File Integrity Verification

Uses SHA-256 hashing to verify file modifications:

```bash
# Check original vs modified file hashes
./main -v  # Shows hash comparison in verbose mode
```

## üîç Understanding the Exploit

### Race Condition Timing

The exploit works by creating a race between two operations:

1. **Thread 1**: `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)` - Tells kernel to discard memory pages
2. **Thread 2**: Writing to `/proc/self/mem` - Attempts to write to mapped memory

### Success Factors

- **Kernel Version**: Must be vulnerable (< 4.8.3)
- **Timing**: Race condition must occur at precise moment
- **Memory Mapping**: File must be mapped with `MAP_PRIVATE`
- **Permissions**: Must have read access to target file

### Why It Works

When the race condition succeeds:
1. Thread 1 discards the COW page
2. Thread 2 writes occur before new COW page is created
3. Write goes directly to original file instead of private copy

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Exploit failed or insufficient iterations"**
- Solution: Increase iterations with `-i` or use multiple processes `-n`

**2. "/proc/self/mem access failed"**
- Solution: Use ptrace method with `-P` flag

**3. "System may not be vulnerable"**
- Check kernel version: `uname -r`
- Ensure kernel is older than 4.8.3

**4. System becomes unresponsive**
- Reduce iterations: `-i 1000000`
- Use fewer processes: `-n 1`

### Performance Tuning

```bash
# Conservative settings (slower but safer)
./main -i 5000000 -n 1

# Aggressive settings (faster but resource intensive)
./main -i 50000000 -n 4 -D

# Balanced settings
./main -i 20000000 -n 2 -r 2 -D
```
